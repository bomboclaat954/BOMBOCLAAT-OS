# BOMBOCLAAT-OS
BOMBOCLAAT-OS is a really simple and dumb operating system (although I wouldn't call it an OS) written in C for fun and to learn something.

# How to build
**IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't use Windows to build this (and any other) OS. Windows sucks in OS development so be smart and use Linux or macOS. **
I hope you installed **gcc, nasm, xorriso, binutils, grub, qemu and qemu-system-x86**.
Clone the repo:
```$ git clone https://github.com/bomboclaat954/BOMBOCLAAT-OS```
Go to cloned folder:
```$ cd BOMBOCLAAT-OS```
Make sure that you have all needed packages and type
```$ make all```
And then:
```$ make run```
Congratulations, you have just built totally useless OS which can't even run on 90% of todays computers because it needs BIOS, not UEFI. Good luck with findng a dinosaur computer to run this XD (just use QEMU or VirtualBox).
